## Notes

- Check off each component as you add it to your schematic
- Verify each net connection matches the schematic_diagrams.md
- Double-check critical components (R4 0.1% tolerance, LDO part number)
- Ensure all capacitors have one terminal to signal/power and one to GND
- Verify all switches connect to GND on one terminal
